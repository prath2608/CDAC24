/*1. Loan Amortization Calculator
Implement a system to calculate and display the monthly payments for a mortgage loan. The system should:
Accept the principal amount (loan amount), annual interest rate, and loan term (in years) from the user.
Calculate the monthly payment using the standard mortgage formula:
Monthly Payment Calculation:
monthlyPayment = principal * (class LoanAmortizationCalculator * (1 + monthlyInterestRate)^(numberOfMonths)) / ((1 + monthlyInterestRate)^(numberOfMonths) - 1)
Where monthlyInterestRate = annualInterestRate / 12 / 100 and numberOfMonths = loanTerm * 12
Note: Here ^ means power and to find it you can use Math.pow( ) method
Display the monthly payment and the total amount paid over the life of the loan, in Indian Rupees (â‚¹).
Define the class LoanAmortizationCalculator with fields, an appropriate constructor, getter and setter methods, a toString method and business logic methods. Define the class LoanAmortizationCalculatorUtil with methods acceptRecord, printRecord, and menuList. Define the class Program with a main method and test the functionality of the utility class.
