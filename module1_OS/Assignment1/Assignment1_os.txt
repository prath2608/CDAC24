Concepts of Operating System 
                                    Assignment 1 
Problem 1: Read the instructions carefully and answer accordingly. If there is 
any need to insert some data then do that as well. 

a) Navigate and List:
a. Start by navigating to your home directory and list its contents. Then, move into a 
directory named "LinuxAssignment" if it exists; otherwise, create it. 

cdac@DESKTOP-4IG5OR6:~$ pwd
/home/cdac
cdac@DESKTOP-4IG5OR6:~$ mkdir LinuxAssignment
cdac@DESKTOP-4IG5OR6:~$ ls
LinuxAssignment



b) File Management:
a. Inside the "LinuxAssignment" directory, create a new file named "file1.txt". Display its 
contents. 
cdac@DESKTOP-4IG5OR6:~$ cd LinuxAssignment
cdac@DESKTOP-4IG5OR6:~/LinuxAssignment$ nano file1.txt
cdac@DESKTOP-4IG5OR6:~/LinuxAssignment$ cat file1.txt

c) Directory Management:
a. Create a new directory named "docs" inside the "LinuxAssignment" directory. 

cdac@DESKTOP-4IG5OR6:~/LinuxAssignment$ mkdir docs
cdac@DESKTOP-4IG5OR6:~/LinuxAssignment$ ls
docs  file1.txt


d) Copy and Move Files:
a. Copy the "file1.txt" file into the "docs" directory and rename it to "file2.txt".
 
cdac@DESKTOP-4IG5OR6:~/LinuxAssignment$ ls
docs  file1.txt
cdac@DESKTOP-4IG5OR6:~/LinuxAssignment$ cp file1.txt docs
cdac@DESKTOP-4IG5OR6:~/LinuxAssignment$ cd docs/
cdac@DESKTOP-4IG5OR6:~/LinuxAssignment/docs$ ls
file1.txt
cdac@DESKTOP-4IG5OR6:~/LinuxAssignment/docs$ mv file1.txt file2.txt
cdac@DESKTOP-4IG5OR6:~/LinuxAssignment/docs$ ls
file2.txt
cdac@DESKTOP-4IG5OR6:~/LinuxAssignment/docs$ cat file2.txt

e) Permissions and Ownership:
a. Change the permissions of "file2.txt" to allow read, write, and execute permissions for 
the owner and only read permissions for others. Then, change the owner of "file2.txt" to 
the current user. 

cdac@DESKTOP-4IG5OR6:~/LinuxAssignment/docs$ chmod u+wx file2.txt
cdac@DESKTOP-4IG5OR6:~/LinuxAssignment/docs$ ls -l
total 4
-rwxrw-r-- 1 cdac cdac 46 Aug 28 22:49 file2.txt

1.Create new user-:
cdac@DESKTOP-4IG5OR6:~/LinuxAssignment/docs$ sudo adduser user2
[sudo] password for cdac:
Adding user `user2' ...
Adding new group `user2' (1002) ...
Adding new user `user2' (1002) with group `user2' ...
Creating home directory `/home/user2' ...
Copying files from `/etc/skel' ...
New password:
Retype new password:
passwd: password updated successfully
Changing the user information for user2
Enter the new value, or press ENTER for the default
        Full Name []: user2
        Room Number []: 201
        Work Phone []: 858565879
        Home Phone []: 25588779
        Other []: 51898/
Is the information correct? [Y/n] y

2.Change the owner of file-:
cdac@DESKTOP-4IG5OR6:~/LinuxAssignment/docs$ sudo chown user2 file2.txt
cdac@DESKTOP-4IG5OR6:~/LinuxAssignment/docs$ ls -l
total 4
-rwxrw-r-- 1 user2 cdac 46 Aug 28 22:49 file2.txt



3.switch the user1-:

cdac@DESKTOP-4IG5OR6:~$ cd /etc/
cdac@DESKTOP-4IG5OR6:/etc$ ls

cdac@DESKTOP-4IG5OR6:/etc$ sudo nano sudoers
[sudo] password for cdac:
cdac@DESKTOP-4IG5OR6:/etc$ sudo ls

cdac@DESKTOP-4IG5OR6:/etc$ cd
cdac@DESKTOP-4IG5OR6:~$ sudo ls
LinuxAssignment
cdac@DESKTOP-4IG5OR6:~$ su user2
Password:
user2@DESKTOP-4IG5OR6:/home/cdac$ sudo ls
[sudo] password for user2:
LinuxAssignment





	f) Final Checklist:
	a. Finally, list the contents of the "LinuxAssignment" directory and the root directory to 
	ensure that all operations were performed correctly. 

	cdac@DESKTOP-4IG5OR6:~/LinuxAssignment$ su user2
	Password:

	user1@DESKTOP-4IG5OR6:/home/cdac$ sudo ls

172.22.63.64

b. Ping a remote server to check connectivity (provide a remote server address to ping). 
cdac@DESKTOP-4IG5OR6:~$ hostname
DESKTOP-4IG5OR6
cdac@DESKTOP-4IG5OR6:~$ hostname -I

j) File Compression:
a. Compress the "docs" directory into a zip file.

cdac@DESKTOP-4IG5OR6:~/LinuxAssignment$ zip docs.zip docs
  adding: docs/ (stored 0%)

b. Extract the contents of the zip file into a new directory. 

cdac@DESKTOP-4IG5OR6:~/LinuxAssignment$ unzip docs.zip -d ./folder
Archive:  docs.zip




k) File Editing:
a. Open the "file1.txt" file in a text editor and add some text to it. 


b. Replace a specific word in the "file1.txt" file with another word (provide the original 
word and the word to replace it with). 











Problem 2: Read the instructions carefully and answer accordingly. If there is 
any need to insert some data then do that as well. 


a. Suppose you have a file named "data.txt" containing important information. Display the 
first 10 lines of this file to quickly glance at its contents using a command.
cdac@DESKTOP-4IG5OR6:~/LinuxAssignment$ head  file1.txt
 
b. Now, to check the end of the file for any recent additions, display the last 5 lines of 
"data.txt" using another command. 
cdac@DESKTOP-4IG5OR6:~/LinuxAssignment$ tail -5 file1.txt


c. In a file named "numbers.txt," there are a series of numbers. Display the first 15 lines of 
this file to analyze the initial data set. 
 head -15 file1.txt

d. To focus on the last few numbers of the dataset, display the last 3 lines of "numbers.txt".
tail -3 file1.txt
 
e. Imagine you have a file named "input.txt" with text content. Use a command to translate 
all lowercase letters to uppercase in "input.txt" and save the modified text in a new file 
named "output.txt." 


f. In a file named "duplicate.txt," there are several lines of text, some of which are 
duplicates. Use a command to display only the unique lines from "duplicate.txt." 
g. In a file named "fruit.txt," there is a list of fruits, but some fruits are repeated. Use a 
command to display each unique fruit along with the count of its occurrences in 
"fruit.txt."
